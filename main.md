Your chapter will be app. 4,500 words long. You should aspire to a narrative
rather than encyclopaedic form and to integrate theory and analysis in
mutually illuminating (but of course not exhaustive ways) that open up new
analytical perspectives, which the student may pursue on his or her own guided
by the suggestions for further reading that will conclude all chapters (i.e.
an annotated bibliography listing ca. five important critical works including
e.g. readers, advanced introductions, one or more crucial theoretical essays
on the given topic).

An archive can be as large as a library or as small as a bookshelf. What are
the minimal requirements to build an archive? How is a pile of haphazardly
arranged papers differ from an archive? Look around you and notice the
furniture, navigate through your mobile device where you keep your notes and
your photos. Think of your social media usage, your habits of correspondence,
the way you keep in touch with your family and friends, the habits of keeping
a journal, taking notes, finding basic facts about the world. All of these
involve an archive of some kind. We are surrounded by archives, we live in
them, and through them. Archives mediate---like water for fish, they form the
medium of our knowledge gathering activity. If, as the headlines tell us, we
live in an information age, the archive is a way of making sense of that
information: more than making sense, keeping the information *at hand*,
pouring over it, organizing, handling it. To archive is not just a mental
activity, in other words, it is physical as well. The archive is an interface
between internal mental states---what I know now---and the external, physical
representations of that knowledge---what I could know always. The book on
myself is not just a book, it is a part of my mental finishings. In many
cases, I don't remember the contents of that book, but I know where it is. I
know I could get to it if needed. It is not as close to me as a memory,
accessible immediately and at once, but also not as far as an obscure fact
with which I have never had any contact. This book on my shelf, this notebook
in a pile on my desk, occupies a space in between my rather limited ability to
remember a few ideas presently and the unlimited amount of ideas out there.
My documents, the ones that belong to me, the ones I organized neatly on the
desk or on a desktop, are ideas that I used to have. I feel safe knowing where
they are and how to find them.

An archive requires at least these
three components: first, a number of documents to be collected; second a place

- Documents
- Architecture
- Metadata

Can there be an archive without documents?  Without a catalog (torah archive).
Without furniture?

## Documents

What gets preserved? Collective memory. 

The dream of preserving everything.  Projection of value and power.

## Architecture

Who gets access? How? Is there a guard at the door? Do you get searched? How
are the rooms arranged?
Shadow Libraries

## Metadata

How are things organized? The scratch collector.

## Conclusion

Public vs. personal archives.
