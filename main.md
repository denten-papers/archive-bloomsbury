An archive can be as large as a library or as small as a bookshelf. What are
the minimal requirements to build an archive? How is a pile of haphazardly
arranged papers differ from an archive? Look around you and notice the
furniture, navigate through your mobile device where you keep your notes and
your photos. Think of your social media usage, your habits of correspondence,
the way you keep in touch with your family and friends, the habits of keeping
a journal, taking notes, finding basic facts about the world. All of these
involve an archive of some kind. We are surrounded by archives; we live in
them, and through them. Archives mediate. Like water for fish, they form the
medium of our knowledge gathering activity. If, as the headlines tell us, we
live in an information age, the archive is a way of making sense of that
information. More than making sense, they help keep information *at hand*, to
handle it, pour over, organize, and process. To archive is not just a mental
activity, in other words, it is physical as well. An archive is a way of
ordering things.

The archive is also an interface between internal mental states---what I know
now---and the external, physical representation of that knowledge---what I
could know at any time. The book on my shelf is not just a book, it is a part
of my mental furnishing. In many cases, I don't remember the contents of that
book, but I know where it is. I know I could get to it if needed. It is not as
close to me as a memory, accessible immediately and at once, but also not as
far as an obscure fact with which I have never had any contact. The book on my
shelf, the notebook in a pile on my desk, occupies a space in between my
rather limited ability to remember a few ideas presently and the unlimited
amount of ideas out there. My documents, the ones that belong to me, the ones
I organized neatly on my desk and on my virtual desktop, are ideas that I used
to have. They are also a part of me, but just slightly farther away than my
thoughts. I feel safe knowing where they are and how to find them. Think of
the discomfort we feel when someone disturbs our archives: if someone were to
reorganize your music collection for example, or scramble the order of your
notes, or rearrange the books on your bookshelf. One feels lost and violated
precisely because the archive is so crucial to our ability to find our way
through a forest of data. It is a small, organized space of private order in
the chaos of information.

Not all islands of order are small and private. Some islands grow into
empires: state archives that project collective power. The aggregate of
personal memories gives us our shared, cultural memory, our heritage. But that
sense of shared culture does not exist in the ether. It is reflected in
publicly and privately supported collections like the Library of Congress and
the Guggenheim Museum. These are large public archives, preserving art and
books, public in the sense of a collective enterprise (not necessarily
funding). They represent a vision of communal memory. It is important however,
that it is a vision, not the vision. A single entity decides what to archive
under an autocratic regime. In democracies, public archives range from massive
state-sanctioned libraries to small, independent organizations like the
*Archiv der Jungendkulturen* in Berlin or the North American Queer Zine
Archive Project out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Other dynamics come into play when the archives grow from islands to
continents of knowledge. In the state archive we begin to think about the
forces of inclusion and exclusion. Who is allowed to enter and who isn't?
Which materials are worthy preservation and which are relegated to the heap of
perishable ephemera? In this way archives can amplify certain historical
narratives while suppressing others. The archive by its very logic projects
the logic of distinction. The most obvious one of these is the distinction of
exclusion: some materials are in, while other are out. The archive of the
court further differentiates between criminals and law-abiding citizens. The
archive of the hospital embodies the distinction between the healthy and sick.
The archive of peer-reviewed scientific publication separates meaningful
knowledge from rumor or mere speculation.

The archive is composed of *records*. From the infinitude of possible
descriptions about reality, the record preserves that which is important.
Think of an obvious example, like a police report. A police report captures
the details of relevant to an incident. A police officer who would write a
novel at the scene of an accident would be dismissed of his or her duties. The
archiving practice of law enforcement requires records of a particular kind.
The archive of a novelist will contain documents drastically different than
those of a police report or a medical record. In this disparity between
everything that can be recorded and the much smaller subset of details that
are recorded lies the normative power of an archive. The archive projects
value, because it contains documents that privilege certain facts over others,
reflecting modes of seeing the world that comply with an archive's collection
policy. The archive creates answers for questions like "What constitutes an
event?" The police report consists of accidents and violations. The medical
record consists of symptoms and diagnoses. The literary record contains
documents relevant to the author's output. In selecting the important events,
or what constitutes an event, the archive constructs a sense of time. Archival
time is made up of records.

Can there be an archive without records or documents? Do the contents of my
pocket---my keys, some change, a crumpled receipt, a piece of
lint---constitute an archive of a kind? What isn't an archive? I would argue
here that an archive requires at least these three components: first, a number
of documents or artifacts to be collected; second a place to store them; and
third, a system of organization. Let us examine each of these archival
components in its turn.

An archive without records, documents, or objects would be an archive in the
name only. We could call it "the library of nothing" but for all purposes it
would resemble an empty room; it would be a promise of an archive---that is,
the promise of records, documents, or objects to come. Could we imagine an
archive without space? A virtual collection perhaps? Again, the question seems
nonsensical. A virtual archive, a website for example, is still a collection
of something occupying the same space, however virtual. An archive of
documents on paper, a list of books to be purchased for example, is again only
an idea, a promise of an archive. Proximity of material is required. Finally,
can an archive exist without a method of organization like a catalog or an
index? Again, it seems not. In the Jewish tradition, holy texts like the Torah
are not to be discarded. For this reason, special sealed rooms, called the
Genizah, have existed to house worn-out documents since the ancient times. The
discovery of such rooms have led to important contributions to the study of
liturgy and poetry in Judaic studies. But do the Genizah constitute an
archive? Or do they become an archive once they are discovered and cataloged?
The catalog is what gives the collection its order. Without the catalog a
pile of papers on my disk is just a pile. The catalog describes the documents
and, most importantly, it tells us how and where to find them.

You can begin to understand now why in thinking about archives I evoked not
only the obvious few public archives like the state library, but also the
numerous small private archives that increasingly house details of our
everyday life. A collection of home photographs on a personal computer answers
all of our minimal definitions of an archive. It consists of documents,
collected in a specially alloted for them space, and described with
meta-data---tags, file names, a method of organized storage and retrieval.
Once the purview of large institutions, the archive is now ubiquitous. We are
all archivists, in a sense, engaged in the activity of capturing, storing, and
sorting records.

## Documents

What gets preserved? Collective memory. 

The dream of preserving everything.  Projection of value and power.

## Architecture

Who gets access? How? Is there a guard at the door? Do you get searched? How
are the rooms arranged?
Shadow Libraries

## Metadata

How are things organized? The scratch collector.

## Conclusion

Public vs. personal archives.
